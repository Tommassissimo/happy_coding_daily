Day 4 - JS prototype

Prototype is a key feature of language JavaScript. Different from Java, C++, there is no class implementation in JavaScript. But by using prototypal model we can simulate the same effect as class does, or even more powerful.

How does it work? Let's see an example:
```js
var People = function(name){
	this.name = name || '';
}
People.prototype.getName = function(){
	return this.name;
}
var p1 = new People("Tom");
p1.getName(); //Tom

var Student = function(school){
	this.school = school || '';
}
Student.prototype = new People(); 
	//later I will discuss the difference with Object.create;
Student.prototype.constructor = Student;
Student.prototype.getSchool = function(){
	return this.school;
}

var s1 = new Student("Tongji");
console.log(s1.name, s1.school); // '' Tongji

//if we use Object.create
var Student = function(school){
	this.school = school || '';
}
Student.prototype = Object.create(People.prototype);
Student.prototype.constructor = Student;

var s1 = new Student("Simone","Tongji");
console.log(s1.name, s1.school); // undefine Tongji

//From my point of view, there is solution to make both cases work as the same. Change Student constructor as follows:
var Student = function(name, school){
	People.call(this, name);
	this.school = school || '';
}
```
This is how prototype works to create a class and make inheritance. Wait, there is one more concept `__proto__`, it is already deprecated and was changed to Object.getPrototypeOf.
Continue the example in previous, `Object.getPrototypeOf(s1) === Student.prototype` will be true. Which means an instance of Student share the same prototype with Student's. But to be noticed that if we change Student prototype later, than the s1.__proto__ still point to the old prototype, not the new one.
