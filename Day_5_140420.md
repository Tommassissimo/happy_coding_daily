Day 5 - AngularJS

From today, I want to spend some time on angularJS, it has been half year since I first knew it. It's time to dig in deeper and try to understand some principle behind. First question is why using angularJS. Let me list the reasons that come out from my mind at this moment:

 * MVC design pattern, make development and debug easier
 * Less code than backbone, and of course the native way
 * New ideas like data binding, directive, dependency injection
